###Language Distance with Perplexity

We provide three languages for train and test: galician (gz), portuguese (pt), spanish (es). The input texts are in the 'corpora' folder.

You can use the script RUN.sh to run a test.


1. To train the models:  

>sh train.sh  gz

>sh train.sh  pt

>sh train.sh  es

This generates the models in the 'models' folder.


2. To run the tests:

>sh test.sh gz gz

>sh test.sh gz pt

>sh test.sh gz es

>sh test.sh pt pt

>sh test.sh pt gz

>sh test.sh pt es

>sh test.sh es es

>sh test.sh es pt

>sh test.sh es gz 

ADDING MORE LANGUAGES
If you wish add a new language, for instance english, you must copy in the corpora folder two new text files: 

./corpora/train/en.txt
./corpora/test/en.txt

The test corpus should be shorter than the train corpus. For instance: 1Mb for the train and 25K for the test. 

Then, you create the model:
> sh  train.sh en

To compare english and portuguese:
> sh test.sh en pt
